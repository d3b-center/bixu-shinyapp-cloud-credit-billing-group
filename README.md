## Cloud Credit Billing Group
This app is designed to visualize the CAVATICA billing group current usage stats. The data in this app is retrieved from [CAVATICA Billing API](https://docs.cavatica.org/reference/billing) and updated daily. It represents the "current usage" in terms of analysis and storage cost; it doesn't have or show previously invoiced data.


The app can be accessed(login required) here: https://d3b-rstudio-connect-public-prd.d3b.io/cloud-credit-billing/
